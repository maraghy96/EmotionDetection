Emotion Detection Web App
Overview
Emotion Detection is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that demonstrates how to analyze and classify emotions in text using Python. The application leverages the power of Flask to deliver a simple web interface where users can input text and receive an emotion analysis based on Watson NLP API. The project showcases modern software engineering practices including unit testing, error handling, and static code analysis.

Features
NLP-Based Emotion Analysis
Analyzes text input and detects primary emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness) using a pretrained language model.

Python & Flask Web Application
Intuitive web interface built with Flask. Accessible locally for easy testing and demonstration.

Unit Testing
All core logic is covered by automated unit tests using Pythonâ€™s unittest framework.

Robust Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling in both backend and web layer, including user-friendly feedback for invalid or blank inputs.

Static Code Analysis
Codebase is verified with PyLint to ensure adherence to Python best practices and maintainability.
